No `grunt` no `Visual Studio`. Just pure coding.\n\n**NOTE**: This branch contains a major rewrite (**v11**) of the `atom-typescript` plugin that is lighter and faster, but lacks a few major features that you might miss. The previous version is still available in the `legacy` branch and will continue to receive minor bugfixes, but I wouldn't count on any new developments.\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Install [atom](https://atom.io).\n2. `apm install atom-typescript` (`apm` needs `git` in your path)\n3. Fire up atom. Open a TypeScript file. Potentially wait for further installs (just `apm install linter` if its not there already).\n\n**Additional Notes**: [Some packages we love](https://github.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript/blob/master/docs/packages.md).\n\n## Reviews\n*Featured on the TypeScript home page under tools http://www.typescriptlang.org/* and [demoed by **Anders Hejlsberg**](https://twitter.com/schwarty/status/593858817894404096).\n\n\"I was shocked at how good it felt to poke around on the compiler with it.\" [Jonathan Turner](https://twitter.com/jntrnr)\n\"And guess what, it worked perfectly. Like everything else! Faster than Visual Studio!\" [Daniel Earwicker](http://stackoverflow.com/users/27423/daniel-earwicker)\n\"It's a thing of beauty - they had me at '*Type information on hover*'. Discovering  `tsconfig.json` support as well was just an enormous bonus.\" [John Reilly](https://twitter.com/johnny_reilly)\n\"This may be your best option for editing TypeScript at the moment - very nice!\" [Rasmus Schultz](https://twitter.com/mindplaydk)\n\n[*Add yours!*](https://github.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript/issues/66)\n\n# Features\n* Autocomplete\n* Live error analysis\n* Type information on hover\n* Compile on save\n* Project Context Support (`tsconfig.json`)\n* Project Build Support\n* `package.json` Support\n* Goto Declaration\n* Find References\n* Block comment and uncomment\n* Rename refactoring\n* Common Snippets\n\n# FAQ\nLocated online : https://github.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript/blob/master/docs/faq.md\n\n----\n\n# Feature Details\n## Auto Complete\nInternally using AutoComplete+. Just start typing and hints will show up. Or you can explicitly trigger it using `ctrl+space` or `cmd+space`. Press `tab` to make a selection.\n\n## Type information on hover\nJust hover\n\n![you definitely get the point](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript/master/docs/screens/hover.png)\n\n## Compile on save\nWhen `\"compileOnSave\": true` is set in `tsconfig.json`, Typescript files will be compiled and saved automatically. The compiler does its best to emit something, even if there are semantic errors in the file.\n\n## Project Support\n`atom-typescript` supports all the same options the Typescript compiler does as it's using it behind the scenes to do all of the heavy lifting. In fact, `atom-typescript` will use the exact version of Typescript you have installed in your `node_modules` directory.\n\n## Format Code\nShortcut : `ctrl+alt+l` or `cmd+alt+l`. Will format just the selection if you have something selected otherwise it will format the entire file.\n\n## Go to Declaration\nShortcut : `F12`. Will open the *first* declaration of the said item for now. (Note: some people call it Go to Definition)\n\n## Find References\nShortcut `shift+F12`. Also called *find usages*.\n\n## Refactoring\n\n### Rename\n`f2` to initiate rename. `enter` to commit and `esc` to cancel.\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript/master/docs/screens/renameRefactoring.png)\n\n## Quick Fix\nShortcut : `ctrl+enter` on a Mac and `alt+enter` for Windows and Linux.\nCurrently available codefixes:\nhttps://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/tree/master/src/services/codefixes\n\n## Contributing\n\nLook at [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for curiosity. We work hard to keep the code as approachable as possible and are highly keen on helping you help us.\n\n## Changelog\nBreaking changes [available online](https://github.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript/blob/master/docs/CHANGELOG.md).\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"atom-typescript@11.0.9","_shasum":"a4463bbca3bce75b14eece75de97af791e55718b","_resolved":"file:../d-117830-92585-5hejnd.qyxk1emi/package.tgz","_from":"../d-117830-92585-5hejnd.qyxk1emi/package.tgz"}
